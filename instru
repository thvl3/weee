# Inject: Discord Webhook Investigation (Focus on calling scripts & broad search)

## Context: /usr/bin/lwp-request appears to be the standard Perl script.
## The rkhunter warning likely means it found a script where it expected a binary.
## We are now looking for *other* scripts/files that call lwp-request (or curl/wget) to Discord.

## 1. Search shell scripts for lwp-request/curl/wget + discord.com
echo "### Searching shell scripts for lwp-request/curl/wget + discord.com ###"
sudo find / -type f -name "*.sh" -exec grep -HniE '(/usr/bin/lwp-request|lwp-request|curl|wget).*discord\.com' {} \; 2>/dev/null

## 2. Search Perl scripts for LWP/lwp-request + discord.com
echo "### Searching Perl scripts for LWP/lwp-request + discord.com ###"
sudo find / -type f \( -name "*.pl" -o -name "*.pm" \) -exec grep -HniE '(LWP::UserAgent|HTTP::Request|/usr/bin/lwp-request|lwp-request).*discord\.com' {} \; 2>/dev/null

## 3. Broad search for the full discord.com/api/webhooks string (filenames only)
# This command can be slow.
echo "### Broad search for full discord.com/api/webhooks string (filenames only) ###"
sudo grep -rli "discord.com/api/webhooks" / 2>/dev/null

## 4. If a suspicious file is found by any of the above (e.g., /path/to/somefile):
# echo "### Example: sudo cat /path/to/somefile ###"

## 5. Reminder on identifying the Webhook ID
echo "### If a Discord webhook URL is found (e.g., https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN), the Webhook ID is the numerical part. ###"
echo "### The script/file containing this URL and making the call is the evidence of the outbound connection. ###"
